# Experiments

## Voxel Generation
Some preprocess is helpful to save training time. We use pre-generated event volumes saved in `.npz` files and flows in `.npy` files. Basically, we follow the data preprocess in [E-RAFT](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/E-RAFT).

The files used in the preprocessing process are placed in the `dataprocess` directory.

We put data in DSEC-Flow folder, and the structure should be like this:
```
|-dsec
    |-voxelandflow
        |-train
            |-thun_00_a
                |-000000.npz
                |-flow_000000.npy
                ...
        |-test
            |-interlaken_00_b
                |-xxxxxx.npz
                ...
    |-images
        |-train
            |-thun_00_a
                |-000000.png
                ...
        |-test
            |-interlaken_00_b
                |-xxxxxx.png
                ...
```

For train data, each `.npz` file contains two consecutive event streams named `events_prev` and `events_curr`, each `flow_xxxxxx.npy` file contains corresponding 16-bit optical flow.

For test data, the `.npz` file is indexed by test timestamp, which is useful for generating predictions for online benchmark.

The image data needs to be calibrated, it is recommended to use the data provided by [bflow](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/bflow).

## For train
```
bash scripts/train.sh
```

## For test
```
bash scripts/gen_upload.sh
```
